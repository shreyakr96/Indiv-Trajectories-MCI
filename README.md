# Indiv-Trajectories-MCI
Estimating individual trajectories of cognitive decline and regional brain volume atrophy in Mild Cognitive Impairment 

These R scripts perform the analyses described in Rajagopal, Shreya K., et al. "Estimating individual trajectories of structural and cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment for early prediction of progression to dementia of the Alzheimer’s type." Scientific Reports 14.1 (2024): 12906.

The scripts with the _Revisions tags are the final scripts associated with these analyses, and they incorporate reviewer feedback.

Script Descriptions: 
ADNI_1_Revisions: LME models of regional brain volumes in the MCI stage (Results section 1)

ADNI_2_Revisions: Predicting progression to dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (Results section 2)

ADNI_3_Revisions: Evaluating the link between rates of structural and cognitive decline (Results section 3)
